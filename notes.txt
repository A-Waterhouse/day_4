understand when runtime errors occour
interpret console and stack traces
understand strategy for debugging 
use console.log

1st line off error output
shows filepath, where the error has occoured, might not be in the file you ran, may be a file you have linked to, location of error and line of error is shown

2nd line error is printed in the error log, shows what is going wrong in more details

rest can be syntax error etc. and more under the hood stuff inthe stack trace

these are hints about what the problem is

syntax checks happen 1st

errors are on MDN site, can give more information
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors


reference error is a runtime error, happens when the code is executed
it gets stopped if it comes up against an error
stack trace can show which method is causing an error, the line of the error etc.

stack shows the state of the calstack when the error happens


examples of errors

cannot read process of undefined (resing 'toString')
error is when trying to invoke the tostring method

console.log before the error to see whatdata type it is and if it is undefined or not

follow the error back to the source and check with console.logs
at some point there will be a part where the input goes into a function and comes out with an error

need to know what to be expecting out of the methods (eg. boolean values/numbers/strings)  and weather the values from the methods should be returned
eg. filter gives out boolean values and must be returned within the method

- solve one error at the time bit by bit
- use the console output where relevent for help
- used console.log to hone in on the location of the problem (error could be in one place but problem elsewhere)
